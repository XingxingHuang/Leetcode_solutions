My solution to Leetcode oj in Python
===============
I am not a CS major, I taught myself python and picked up bits of knowledge about algorithm and data structure here and there. My coding style is chaotic, sometimes prefer list compreshion over loops, sometimes prefer lambda function over sub routines.

谨以此REPO记录本菜————一个非计算机相关专业野路子人士————的自我修养之路。
